## Render GitHub flavored markdown as HTML
Don't know how to write in markdown?  Here's a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

You can write inline code: \`<div>Hello World!</div>\`

and code blocks...
\`\`\`
<h1>Hello...</h1>
<h2>World</h2>
\`\`\`
You can also write lists:
1. **Bold text**
2. ~~Strikethrough~~

And of course, images with quotes:

![Abraham Lincoln](./Abe.png "Abraham Lincoln")

> "Don't believe everything you read on the internet just because there's a quote with a picture on it."
>
>  \\- Abraham Lincoln`;

export default defaultText;
